# Pipelined RISC Processor Design and Implementation

This project is a Verilog implementation of a 32-bit pipelined RISC processor. It supports a basic instruction set and demonstrates the key stages of instruction processing using pipelining: instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back.

## Features

- 32-bit instruction and data word size
- Five pipeline stages: IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB
- Hazard detection and forwarding to handle data hazards
- Basic instruction set with arithmetic, logic, load/store, and branch instructions
- Separate instruction and data memory modules
- Testbenches for functional verification
- Datapath and control unit designed for pipelining efficiency
